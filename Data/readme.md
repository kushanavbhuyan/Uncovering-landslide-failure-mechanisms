# Important information

1. Please double-check if all the data are in the geographic coordinate system. The code will not work unless both the shapefiles and Digital Elevation Models are in the same WGS84 formatted system.

2. Access to the Turkish inventory data can be provided upon request.

3. Some files cannot be shared due to restrictions of size on GitHub. However, most data are openly accessible therefore, a quick Google search should most likely suffice.
