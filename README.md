# Uncovering landslide failure types



This repository is under construction and still uploading clean codes. Note some existing codes might still have bugs. 

"Sample data" contains the arrays that were generated using TDA. The data can be used to train any ML/DL model. 

We also release the documentation of two inventories from Fan et al. (2019) which are now documented with failure-type information.
